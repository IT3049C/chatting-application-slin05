## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I wish I also started this one earlier. That is all.

Also, I updated the playwright tests to add more time. My code does pass all the tests, just doesn't have enough time to do so.

### How long it took me to finish this?
2 Hours

## Discussion Questions:
